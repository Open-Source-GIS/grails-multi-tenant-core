    <h1><a name="1. Overview">1. Overview</a></h1>The grails multi-tenant plugin allows you to run multiple "customers" (or tenants) from one installation of a grails application with minimum configuration. Application developers who would normally have to install multiple instance of their grails app (one-per-customer) and maintain multiple databases (one-per-customer) can use this plugin to run multiple customers from the same application AND database. The plugin also supports a single-tenant database configuration (one webapp for all tenants, but a datasource for each tenant)<h2><a name="1.1 Our goal">1.1 Our goal</a></h2>We want the plugin to be as non-intrusive and easy to use as possible. You should write your application as if it's for one customer, and the plugin should convert all necessary resources to multi-tenant as needed.
