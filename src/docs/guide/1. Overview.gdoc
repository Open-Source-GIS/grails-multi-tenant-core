The grails multi-tenant plugin allows you to run multiple "customers" (or tenants) from one installation of a grails application with minimum configuration. Application developers who would normally have to install multiple instance of their grails app (one-per-customer) and maintain multiple databases (one-per-customer) can use this plugin to run multiple customers from the same application AND database. The plugin also supports a single-tenant database configuration (one webapp for all tenants, but a datasource for each tenant)
